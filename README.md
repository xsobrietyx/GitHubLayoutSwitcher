> Chrome extension that redirects to the better (from my point of view) layouts in github.com and gist.github.com

## How it works
Chrome extension that based on current GitHub API and redirects in two particular cases:
- (A) https://github.com -> https://github.com/PROFILE_NAME
- (B) https://gist.github.com/PROFILE_NAME -> https://gist.github.com/PROFILE_NAME/public


## User guide
- Add extension to the Google Chrome Browser
- Set your user name using extension input field
- Done
